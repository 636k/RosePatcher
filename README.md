# vino-config-patcher-plugin
A Wii U Aroma plugin that patches a TVii config file with a custom one from your SD card to redirect it's urls.

The file `vino_config.txt` should be placed in the directory: `sd:/TVii/vino_config.txt`. Failure to do so will result in a console crash with a neat little message telling you to basically do what you should've already been doing. This is a fully foolproof plugin for sure!
